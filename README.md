# Flutter Experiments

This is the main repository for (soon to be) a bunch of sample flutter apps that demonstrate things that I found interesting.
Each folder contains an example app, a brief explanation of the implementation, and a GIF.

Let me know if you find a better way to do something! I'm always open to learning more.

## Current Experiments:

1. [Dark Mode Setting](https://github.com/AbsoluteSpace/flutter_experiments/tree/master/dark_mode)
